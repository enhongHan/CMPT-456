1273781908338388992	What are you talking about?? How to vote? If that‚Äôs it, I posted my tweet so people who haven‚Äôt voted might make them change their minds. It‚Äôs good for them to be informed before they go to the polls. There is a lot of good info in there. Every state is handling it different.
1273781908267241472	I just asked a question 
1273781908225343494	U have a moustache
1273781908195901440	haha right? I know xD I really started pondering it in more depth a few years back after listening to Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku, which I listened to recently with my girlfriend again. Made me realize my less than algebra level of mathematics knowledge was going to stop me.

1273781908095164416	This is not just about companies hoodwinking citizens, it is about a government which is completely clueless about managing any ordeal the country faces except making a marketing gimic out of it, and citizens who have been blinded by nationalism for an individual. 
1273781908082765825	Interesting that you point out to Zhanaozen. That's such a sadly forgotten, unaccounted episode

1273781907914809345	I believe that‚Äôs the idea. I also believe that ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù here is the word chosen by the blog to translate ÂõΩÊ∞ë, is it? @UnseenJapanSite I think that like the stimulus payout this is a case where a term that can also mean ‚Äúresidents of the nation‚Äù is translated to citizen
1273781907910725634	This is a BIG development..might have to buy an Xbox for it..
1273781907898204167	Agree 100% - this is a wonderful album, start to finish. I especially love ‚ÄòThe Queen and the Soldier‚Äô, but the whole album is great.

1273781907705212928	I think this might be a better outcome. If the SC were to strike down DACA, I am afraid that the DEMs and some RINOs will come up with some BS immigration reform and give citizenship to all DACA and their families. With this outcome, they don't get citizenship (and vote Dems)

1273781907625398272	My dad used to believe in you because you were the lesser of two evils in 2016, but man hes embarrassed to be a Republican because of what you've done. You may be a good businessman, but your "good business" was built off of a skewed and tinted morality that sucks the needy dry.

1273781907487064066	Seems to me @PeterMacKay won the English debate. Nobody connected with a punch and he didn't tongue-trip himself into trouble. Not sure it was a performance that will enrapture the urban vote for the next election, but it won't give his bid rivals the lift they badly needed.
1273781907482800128	... I just don't believe a CPC of 100:1 sales is a realistic ratio. No f__king way. They're being gamed, but they don't care as they make money both ways :(

1273781907335987201	The funding cluster changes to arts degrees announced by Dan Tehran are just bizarre. At a time when employers are saying ‚Äúwe want grads with better critical thinking skills‚Äù you double the price of the only major degree exclusively devoted to critical engagement with texts?!

1273781906681839616	Yes. Where are your sources to support King was a conservative. Your argument has no evidence. You haven‚Äôt read history if you really think he was a conservative. He was anti-poverty, anti-war, anti-imperialism, a virulent antiracist. There is nothing conservative about that.

1273781906098860032	That could just be me, I don't even like normal gameplay videos or live-streams unless they add something that's not just commentary.

1273781905385762817	It's a #RacismBot, a bot programmed to incite racist / anti-racist conflict. It's a psychological attack, designed to validate Trump, and directly attack anti-racism. It's all about blaming racism on its victims, and defense of the status quo, revalidating their scapegoating.
1273781905301921795	I think I‚Äôm Twittered out. A fun diversion turned into a pile of steaming dung pretty damn quick.

1273781905020923908	Good and relatively reasonable thoughts in your thread, Brother. I don't see blind allegiance to PP and I would think PP can defend himself and explain himself to anyone that wants a conversation. I would apply the same rational to the people that you listed in your thread. 1/3

1273781874159169537	Do the math, facts are facts silly rabbit. Lol but I called it a deflection &amp; talking point because the subject at hand is police brutality against black ppl, nothing more, nothing less. It is discriminatory, racist &amp; wrong. It‚Äôs really not a debate. 
1273781874134077440	Many a Black mans life was reduced to nothing or even ended, on account of his curiosity and fascination with white women.
1273781874134069249	It's a parody! It's fun, it's lighthearted, meant to make you smile and consider what's going on in our country regarding fake news and race relations.

1273781873924141057	Thanks mate that's consistent with my read on things. Interesting point on the relative amounts compared with the disability and potentially aged pension. It does present a challenging argument for them if they wish to maintain a higher amount for JobSeeker.

1273781872674439171	EXACTLY!!!! I'll tell you one thing, I'd have done the same thing. I hope he has bail money and a lawyer. He better not spend any time in jail for this. His case is the textbook definition of self defense.
1273781872674213889	What I find totally baffling is why the Tory Party can‚Äôt see what is happening and get a grip. Doesn‚Äôt need too many to take the moral high ground and topple the whole lot. Even get the Russian Report out would be a start.
1273781872666034176	Many did, and it was obvious at times. Other times we just thought they were singing to instrumental Tracks. But now I'm an old fart, lip synced quit a bit. We didn't care then. 
1273781872615710720	Fully agree. That's why they have it opened so long. Ages now it must move. They need to find a way post COVID-19 to address this
1273781872569380864	@AMCTheatres Looks like I'm canceling my A-List membership! Scientific fact is not a political opinion. You CLEARLY don't care about patrons. 
1273781872535965696	And all the previous tweets, everything that must‚Äôve been said. And the posts on her finsta too, maybe a few with her feeling absolutely disgusted you know, how much she despises me, I get it

1273781872435146752	He has divided a country, neglected care of his people and shown nothing but a selfish and arrogant intent. He does not lead, he dictates. Biden may not have it all, but he has more to offer than Trump has ever given.

1273781872296747008	Imagine in a world where profit margin is much more comfortably wide because not everything is being automated, overpaying top management, inflated way out of low/middle class, we could actually pay people proper wages for the right job 
1273781872250753024	Yes. Yes they do. They really do it to get the sheep all in a tizzy. Usually works too
1273781872150052866	Treating social media outlets like utilities is one solution I think is reasonable to pursue at least investigating (eg, how would it work in practice, what's their economic model under such a system, etc).
